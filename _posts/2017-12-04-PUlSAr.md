<h2>PUlSAr</h2> is a motion-detecting device which uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects. This project is one step above the basics in microcontroller circuitry and programming.

<h2>Materials</h2>
To get started, you'll need:
<ul>
<li>Access to the [Arduino Web Editor] or [Arduino IDE]</li>
<li>The PUlSAr Kit, Including:
  <ul>
  <li>Arduino or Arduino-Compatible Microcontroller</li>
  <li>USB Microcontroller Power Cord</li>
  <li>Solderless Breadboard</li>
  <li>Breadboard Ultrasonic Sensor</li>
  <li>Breadboard LEDs</li>
  <li>Breadboard Buzzer</li>
  <li>Jumper Wires</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>


If you'd like to build PUlSAr yourself, you can purchase a full, unassembled kit [here]({{site.baeurl}}{% link purchases/purchasePUlSAr.md %}). 

If you already have an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, or any of the other PUlSAr components, you can buy the remaining items from [this list].
