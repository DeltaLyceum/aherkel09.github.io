<strong>PUlSAr</strong> is a motion-detecting device which uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects. This project is one step above the basics in microcontroller circuitry and programming.

<h2>Materials</h2>
To get started, you'll need:

<ul>
<li>Access to the [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/getting-started-with-the-arduino-web-editor-4b3e4a) or [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)</li>
<li>The PUlSAr Kit, Including:
  <ul>
  <li>(1) Arduino or Arduino-Compatible Microcontroller</li>
  <li>(1) USB Microcontroller Power Cord</li>
  <li>(1) Solderless Breadboard</li>
  <li>(1) Breadboard Ultrasonic Sensor</li>
  <li>(1) Breadboard Buzzer</li>
  <li>(2) Breadboard LEDs</li>
  <li>(2) 220 Ohm Resistors (Not Shown)</li>
  <li>(11) Jumper Wires</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

If you'd like to build PUlSAr yourself, you can purchase a full, unassembled kit [here]({{site.baeurl}}{% link purchases/purchasePUlSAr.md %}).

<h2>Step 1: Unpacking Your Kit</h2>

Once you have received your PUlSAr kit, be sure to verify that you have the components listed above. I recommend that you test your Microcontroller before you begin.

Plug it in to an open USB port or directly into the wall and verify that it turns on. If you are using the Hiletgo UNO Microcontroller that comes with the kit, you will need to download the [CH340 driver] and follow the installation instructions before you can upload scripts to your board. Once you have done this, open the Arduino IDE and plug your Microcontroler into an available USB port. Navigate to Tools>Port and select COM4. Your Microcontroller is ready to go. 

<h2>Step 2: Assembly</h2>

Begin by placing the Ultrasonic Sensor on the Breadboard. Note that the sensor has four pins: a VCC pin a TRIG pin, an ECHO pin, and a GND pin. Connect the 5V pin on the Microcontroller to VCC, Digital I/O Pin No. 10 to TRIG, connect No. 11 to ECHO, and wire the GND pin to an empty row on the Breadboard.

Next, connect the Buzzer to the Breadboard. Wire Digital I/O Pin No. 9 to the positive terminal of the Buzzer, and connect the other terminal to the same Breadboard row as the GND wire from the Ultrasonic Sensor.

After the buzzer is installed, place the two LEDs on the Breadboard. Insert the 220 Ohm Resistors into the same row as the longer terminal of the LEDs. From the resistors, connect a wire to Digital I/O Pins Nos. 8 and 12. Connect a ground wire from the open terminal of the LEDs to the same Breadboard row as the other components.

Finally, ground all of the components by connecting the final Jumper Wire to any GND pin on the Microcontroller.

<h2>Step 3: Programming PUlSAr</h2>

Open the Arduino IDE and begin by declaring variables for the Sensor Pins, the Buzzer, and the LEDs. Make sure to map the Digital I/O Pins to the various components as you connected them.

Secondly, complete your void setup by initializing each of the Digital I/O Pins in the proper state.

The void loop defines the control sequence for PUlSAr. Begin with the digitalWrite(LOW) command to set or reset each Digital I/O Pin to the "off" state. Next, the Ultrasonic Sensor sends out a ... microsecond pulse of sound at a specific frequency from the ... Pin. The sound waves travel to the nearest object and are reflected back toward the Sensor. The Echo Pin listens for the sound to return and measures the time between the pulse and the detection. Using this time interval and a constant 340 m/s for the speed of sound, the distance to the nearest object can be calculated as follows:

The final segment of the loop establishes a threshold distance of 15 cm. If the Sensor detects an object below that distance, the Microcontroller uses the digitalWrite(HIGH) command to turn on the Buzzer and the LEDs. They will stay on for as long as an object is detected below the threshold.

After executing all of the code, the void loop is repeated continually as long as the Microcontroller has power.

<h2>Step 4: Upload & Enjoy</h2>

In the Arduino IDE, Verify your sketch to ensure the code has been entered properly. Next, Upload the sketch to your Microcontroller and test out your completed PUlSAr kit!
