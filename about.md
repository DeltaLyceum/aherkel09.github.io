Δ-Lyceum bears the namesake of the [Lyceum]({{page.external_url}}), the temple which hosted Aristotle's Peripatetic School of Philosophy. Under its covered walkways, philosophical and scientific inquiries were once conducted. Endeavoring to carry the torch of discovery in a new domain, I have prepended the Greek letter Δ as a symbol of growth and change.

Δ-Lyceum is a work in progress. Here, you'll find a burgeoning resource for information on science & technology, as well as an expanding list of projects to engage novice and experienced tinkerers alike. 

I invite you to learn new things. I encourage you to build the future you envision. I challenge you to change everything.
