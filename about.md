Δ-Lyceum carries the namesake of the [Lyceum]({{page.external_url}}), the temple which hosted Aristotle's Peripatetic School of Philosophy. Many curious Athenians once gathered in the Lyceum to hear Aristotle lecture and teach. Under its covered walkways, many philosophical and scientific inquiries were conducted. I have prepended the Greek letter Δ as a symbol of growth and change.

Δ-Lyceum is a work in progress. Here, you'll find a developing website, an expanding list of projects, and a deepening well of knowledge and experience. I sound the call to fellow explorers: come and join in the discovery.

I invite you to learn new things. I encourage you to build the future you envision. I challenge you to change everything.
