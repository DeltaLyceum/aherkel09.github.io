Delta-Lyceum carries the namesake of the [Lyceum]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum_(Classical)), the temple which hosted Aristotle's Peripatetic School of Philosophy. Many curious Athenians once gathered in the Lyceum to hear Aristotle lecture and teach. Under its covered walkways, many philosophical and scientific inquiries were conducted. Today, we have prepended the Greek letter Î” as a symbol of growth and change, for this is what drives us to achieve.

Delta-Lyceum is a work in progress. Here, you'll find a developing website, an expanding list of projects, and a widening base of knowledge and experience. As we venture forth into the unknown, we sound the call to fellow explorers: come and discover with us.

We invite you to learn and to grow. We encourage you to build the future you envision. We challenge you to change everything.
